# Wine Quality Prediction using Random Forest Classifier

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties using the Random Forest Classifier. The dataset used is the Wine Quality dataset, which contains various attributes related to wine characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following features:

- **fixed acidity**: The amount of fixed acid in the wine.
- **volatile acidity**: The amount of volatile acid in the wine.
- **citric acid**: The amount of citric acid in the wine.
- **residual sugar**: The amount of residual sugar in the wine.
- **chlorides**: The amount of chlorides in the wine.
- **density**: The density of the wine.
- **pH**: The pH level of the wine.
- **sulphates**: The amount of sulphates in the wine.
- **alcohol**: The alcohol content of the wine.
- **quality**: The quality rating of the wine (target variable).

### Sample Data
```
| fixed acidity | volatile acidity | citric acid | residual sugar | chlorides | density | pH   | sulphates | alcohol | quality |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|---------|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| 7.4           | 0.70             | 0.00        | 1.9            | 0.076     | 0.9978  | 3.51 | 0.56      | 9.4     | 5       |

| 7.4           | 0.70             | 0.00        | 1.9            | 0.076     | 0.9978  | 3.51 | 0.56      | 9.4     | 5       |
```

## Model Training
The Random Forest Classifier was trained on the dataset, achieving an accuracy of **65%**.

### Model Evaluation
The evaluation metrics for the model are as follows:

```

### Class Distribution
The distribution of the target variable (quality) is as follows:
```
0       5
1       5
2       5
3       6
4       5
...
1594    5
1595    6
1596    6
1597    5
1598    6
```

## Conclusion
The Random Forest Classifier provides a baseline for predicting wine quality, but the model's performance indicates that further improvements are needed. Possible next steps include:
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Exploring other classification algorithms
- Addressing class imbalance
